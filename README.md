A userscript that shows Little Bridges Series cache stats on geocaching.com.

A userscript that shows A Fine Pair cache stats on geocaching.com. It adds the [Little Bridges](https://www.littlebridgesseries.co.uk) banner in the following places:

* the Stats Bar area of your account dashboard (old UI);
* the sidebar of your account dashboard (new UI)
* your public profile (old and new UIs);
* other users' profiles (old and new UIs);
* Little Bridges cache pages.

On cache pages it adds the C. O.'s banner as well.

## Credits

This script was inspired by, and is based on, James Inge's [Church Micro Stats](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/9641-church-micro-stats) and works in concert with it, as you can see from the screen shots. Thanks and credit should go to James for his efforts.

The icon image is extracted from the Little Bridges banner by Chris AKA Bus.Stop
